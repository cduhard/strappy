h1. Strappy - Authlogic

Bootstrap a Rails 2.3 app with a template using Authlogic

The original template that uses "restful_authentication":http://github.com/pixels-and-bits/strappy/tree/restful_authentication

h2. What does this thing have in it

  * Haml 2.1
  * Haml views
  * Sass stylesheets
  * jQuery 1.3
  * jQueryUI 1.5
  * Blackbird for UI debugging
  * CC.rb rake task
  * Capistrano with Staging and Production environments
  * A defualt 'home' controller in place of index.html
  * A ready to go Authlogic setup for login with password resets
  * A strappy rake task to install commonly used plugins (lifted from Bort)

Admittedly this thing kind of steps out side of the box in what I believe they 
intended application templates to do by bringing in controllers and specs.
  
h3. gems

  * GemTools to manage gems and versions
  * SiteConfig to manage the app congiguration
  * RSpec for testing
  * Rcov to help make sure you are testing
  * WillPaginate for pagination
  * Authlogic to handle authentication
  * ExposeModel to tidy up your controllers and views
  
h3. plugins

  * jRails to handle jQuery
